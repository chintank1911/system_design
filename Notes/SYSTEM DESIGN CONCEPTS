SYSTEM DESIGN CONCEPTS



FUNDAMENTAL TOPICS

Client Server Architecture


DNS
browser cache --> miss --> DNS (ISP)  - ICANN


Load Balancer - HOt standby
- balances load
- mantains health (healtchecks) ? 
- Push - Heartbeat 
- Pull model - LB  
- Rate Limiting
- Ddos attack


API Gateway
- redirect to correct service
- 


Databases
- SQL , NoSQL
- SQL - Structured, Related, , ACID Transactions - Highly Consistency 
- NoSQL - Unstructured - Document DB (Mongo DB, Couchbase), Graph DB (Neo4j), Images & Videos, Columnar DB (Cassandra), Key Value (Redis, Dynamo DB), Ledgers (??) , Timeseries DB (Influx DB stock markets), Text Search (Elastic Search, Lucene)
High Availability


Caches -
In memory cache - guava cache
Server Level Cache - 
Browser Cache
Cache to buffer reads from DB
CDN - Streaming, Static  - Akamai, Cloudfront, 

Cache Miss, Cache Hit, Type - Write Back, Write Around, Write Through


Advanced Topics

High AVailability
- Abstract or Measure

5 9s or above
99.9999
99.999 - 6 minutes
99.99
..
99 - 80 


High Consistency

consensus - Paxos
leader election

Transactionally Consistent

Eventual Consistency - 

Dirty Reads temporarily



Popular Theorems

CAP Theorem

PACELC Theorem

If Partition Availability or Consistency  Else Latency or Consistency

if partition:
  chose between availabilty or consistency - (CAP)
else:
  chose between latency or consistency  - Low Latency/ Eventual Consistency vs High Latency/High(er)  Consistency 

FLP Impossibility Theorem


CASE STUDY BLOOM FILTER

probabilistic data structure to check memebership

if bloom filter says - NOT PRESENT - 100 % guaranteed

PRESENT - may or may not be
