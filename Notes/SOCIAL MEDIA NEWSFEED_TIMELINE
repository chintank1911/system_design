- NFR
1) High Availability Eventual Consistency
2) Low Latency


SCALE / BOE CALCULATIONS
1) Metrics - QPS - Read / Write ( Ready heavy or Write Heavy ? Read Heavy)
2) Storage 

DAU = 1 billion

Rqps /Wqps / Storage (1 day, 5 years)
wQPS = 10 ^ 4 QPS ((posters x posts per day) / 10 ^5)

rQPS = 20 X 10^4 (assuming 1: 20) = wQPS X 20 = rQPS



Storage = 100 million X 1 post X 1 KB = 100 X 10^6 X 10^3 = 100 GB perday
(Post size, Active user posting will are overestimated)



posts_table

user_id     text                path_to_attachment
